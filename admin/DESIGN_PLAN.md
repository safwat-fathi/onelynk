## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design plan for the ZeeLink Admin Dashboard, a central interface for managing links, products, users, and overall application settings. The goal is to create an intuitive, efficient, and visually appealing experience for administrators.

## 2. Target Audience

The primary users of the ZeeLink Admin Dashboard are administrators and content managers who need to:
- Monitor overall application performance and key metrics.
- Create, edit, and delete links.

- **Accessibility**: Adherence to accessibility standards to ensure usability for all.

## 4. Screens

The dashboard will consist of the following key screens:

### 4.1. Dashboard Overview
- **Purpose**: Provide a high-level summary of key metrics (e.g., total links, active users, recent activity, product sales).
- **Key Elements**: Overview cards, recent activity feed, quick links to other sections.

### 4.2. Links Management

### 4.5. Settings

## 5. Layout

The dashboard will follow a standard admin layout:

- **Sidebar Navigation (Left)**: Persistent navigation menu with main sections (Dashboard, Links, Products, Users, Settings).
- **Header (Top)**: Contains application title/logo, user profile/logout, and potentially global search or notifications.
- **Content Area (Main)**: The primary area where screen-specific content is displayed.
